# JSND-Mars-Dashboard
Repo contains project code for Udacity's JSND project - Mars Dashboard

### Big Picture
You are going to create a dashboard that consumes the NASA API. Your dashboard will allow the user to select which rover's information they want to view. Once they have selected a rover, they will be able to see the most recent images taken by that rover, as well as important information about the rover and its mission. Your app will make use of all the functional concepts and practices you have learned in this course, and the goal is that you would become very comfortable using pure functions and iterating over, reshaping, and accessing information from complex API responses.



### Project Requirements

To complete this project, your UI must show the following:

  * A gallery of the most recent images sent from each mars rover.
  * The launch date, landing date, name and status along with any other information about the rover.
  * A selection bar for the user to choose which rover's information they want to see.

To complete this project, your UI must do the following:

  * Be responsive. Needs to look good (AKA not broken) on the following devices:
    * Phones (max-width 768px)
    * Desktop (min-width 991px, max-width 1824px).
    * [Optional] Tablet view
  
  * Provide a way to dynamically switch the UI to view one of the three rovers. (NOTE: This can be done using tabs, buttons, or any other UI control)

To complete this project, your frontend code must:
  * Use only pure functions.
  * Use at least one Higher Order Function.
  * Use the array method map.
  *Use the ImmutableJS library.

To complete this project, your backend code must:
  * Be built with Node/Express.
  * Make successful calls to the NASA API.
  * Use pure functions to do any logic necessary.
  * Hide any sensitive information from public view (In other words, use your dotenv file).

### Above and Beyond
The NASA API has a lot more data to offer than what we are using here. There's no extra credit in this course, but it could be fun to explore their API and see what they have to offer and what strikes your creativity to add to your project. You are not limited to the API calls we require. Look here at the Browse API's section to see all that's available.

Some ideas might be to incorporate the Astronomy Photo of the Day into your design, collect weather information on Mars, etc...

### Design
Create an image gallery slider, put a full-page background image, code some falling asteroids with CSS animations ... the visual design of this UI is up to you! There is a lot of awesome dashboard design inspiration out there. You have already been given a good start with a mobile-first stylesheet already set up for you.
